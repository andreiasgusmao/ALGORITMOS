,@USAirways 2nd time this occurred in 3 weeks. I'm not patient. I have no choice.  #Antitrust issue
. @SouthwestAir condescension must be a quality your co rewards. Your tone reeks of it
. @united 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines
. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
. @united you know your updates every 6 hours telling me you don't know where my bags are is also equally irritating. #ColtsMissingBags
. @USAirways It's been Cancelled Flighted. Your SM response is slow.

.@AmericanAir (2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue.
.@AmericanAir @C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I've been trying since last night to get through.
.@AmericanAir @Kaha58 Would be nice if you could actually talk to the reserv. team...it just hangs up on you and has been since last night.
.@AmericanAir @TyWinter it's really the small things--the details--that make an excellent experience or a really irritating one.
".@AmericanAir @USAirways Add insult to injury you guys ""misplaced"" my bag. "
.@AmericanAir Advised GAs and pilot of my flight. Too bad no one took action.
